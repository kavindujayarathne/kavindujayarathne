<h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<p>
I'm Kavindu, a Software Engineering undergraduate from Sri Lanka. I would like to refer me as an explorer more than being labeled as a specific developer role. I would love to explore different kinds of technologies, some complex concepts and tech stacks. I'm currently playing on Web Dev. Btw I'm an Athlete as well.</p>
